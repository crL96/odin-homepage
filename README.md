# odin-homepage

Project within "The Odin Project" - Path: Full Stack Javascript - Course: Advanced HTML/CSS - Project: Homepage


Project description:

For your final HTML/CSS project, you’re going to create a responsive homepage, something you might find on a portfolio site of sorts. When you get to the point that you want to start sharing your work, or applying for jobs, it’s useful to have a well-designed portfolio to share. While we won’t be making one yet, you’ll want practice with these more advanced HTML and CSS concepts first, so take this as an opportunity to practice them!

Similarly to landing page and admin dashboard from previous projects, you are tasked to build a given design brief. We’re providing a full design in 3 different sizes, full desktop, tablet and mobile, and this is the first real project where you should take your time and make sure that it looks acceptable at any screen size.
